# Pressure fluctuation of the Ender 3 syringe pumps: 

Thanks to Rahat Haque and Maiwenn Kersaudy-Kerhoas (https://www.ed.ac.uk/infection-medicine/our-staff/associate-members/dr-maiwenn-kersaudy-kerhoas-profile) who have measured the pressure fluctuation of the Ender 3 syringe pumps using their developed methodology, which you can read it here: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0057415

The outcome is that the the open-source ENDER pump performs as well as the Aladdin pump (classical red syringe pumps) over a large range of flow rate and pressures, at a fraction of the price. It should be noted that it is not suitable for precise operation.
