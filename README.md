Ender 3 syringe pumps is an open source and open hardware device for converting an Ender 3 kit to a set of 3 syringe pumps. Almost everything needed for the build is the Ender 3 kit, even all the screws and the tools needed for the assembly. 
The only parts which needed to be bought are three 5x5 shaft couplers and M5 lead screw. 
All the 3D designs are in the /hardware folder. 

## Structure 
+ /hardware is a folder with the 3D printable files and a guide for the assembly 
+ /software is a folder with the instruction on how to use the pumps via gcode 
+ /videos are few video of the pumps in action
