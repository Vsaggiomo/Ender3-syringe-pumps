# Ender 3 syringe pumps: open-source set of syringe pumps from an Ender 3 kit\
\
Visit the [**ChemRxiv**][1] for the preprint.\
\
Ender 3 syringe pumps is an open source and open hardware device for converting an Ender 3 kit to a set of 3 syringe pumps. Almost everything needed for the build is the Ender 3 kit, even all the screws and the tools needed for the assembly. \
The only parts which needed to be bought are three 5x5 shaft couplers and M5 lead screw. \
All the 3D designs are in the /hardware folder. \
\
## Structure \
+ /hardware is a folder with the 3D printable files and a guide for the assembly \
+ /software is a folder with the instruction on how to use the pumps via gcode \
+ /videos are few video of the pumps in action\
